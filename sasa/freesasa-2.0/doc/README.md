C-library for calculating Solvent Accessible Surface Areas.

License: MIT (see file LICENSE). Copyright: Simon Mitternacht 2013-2016.

FreeSASA is a C library and command line tool for calculating Solvent
Accessible Surface Area (SASA) of biomolecules. It is designed to be
simple to use with defaults, but allows customization of all
parameters of the calculation and provides a few different tools to
analyze the results. Python bindings are also included in the
repository.

By default Lee & Richards' algorithm is used, but Shrake & Rupley's is
also available. Both can be parameterized to arbitrary precision, and
for high resolution versions of the algorithms, the calculations give
identical results.

FreeSASA assigns a radius and a class to each atom. The atomic radii
are by default the _ProtOr_ radii defined by Tsai et
al. ([JMB 1999, 290: 253](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10388571))
for standard amino acids and nucleic acids, and the van der Waals
radius of the element for other atoms. Each atom is also classified as
either polar or apolar.

Users can provide their own atomic radii and classifications via
configuration files. The input format for configuration files is
described in the
[online documentation](http://freesasa.github.io/doxygen/Config-file.html),
and the `share/` directory contains some sample configurations,
including one for the NACCESS parameters
([Hubbard & Thornton 1993](http://www.bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/naccess/)).

Version 2.0 adds some new features and breaks a few parts of the
interface from 1.x (mainly the API), see CHANGELOG.md for detailed
information.

Building and installing
------------------------

FreeSASA can be compiled and installed using the following

    ./configure
    make && make install

NB: If the source is downloaded from the git repository the
configure-script needs to be set up first using `autoreconf -i`. Users
who don't have autotools installed, can download a tarball that
includes the autogenerated scripts from http://freesasa.github.io/ or
from the latest
[GitHub-release](https://github.com/mittinatten/freesasa/releases).

The above commands build and install the command line tool `freesasa`
(built in `src/`), the command

    freesasa -h

gives an overview of options. To run a calculation from PDB-file input
using the defaults, simply type

    freesasa <pdb-file>

In addition, `make install` installs the header `freesasa.h` and the
library `libfreesasa`. If the configure script is called with the
option `--enable-python-bindings`, the Python module is also built and
installed.

The configuration can be changed with these options:
* `--enable-python-bindings` builds Python bindings, requires Cython
    0.21 or higher. On some platforms the C library needs to be
    compiled with `CFLAGS=-fPIC` to allow it to be linked to the
    Python module.
* `--with-python=<python>` specifies which python binary to use
* `--disable-json` build without support for JSON output.
* `--disable-xml` build without support for XML output.
* `--disable-threads` build without multithreaded calculations
* `--enable-doxygen` activates building of Doxygen documentation

For developers:
* `--enable-check` enables unit-testing using the Check framework
* `--enable-gcov` adds compiler flags for measuring coverage of tests
    using gcov
* `--enable-parser-generator` rebuild parser/lexer source from
    Flex/Bison sources (the autogenerated code is included in the
    repository, so no need to do this if you are not going to change
    the parser).

Documentation
-------------

Enabling Doxygen builds a [full reference
manual](http://freesasa.github.io/doxygen/), documenting both CLI and
API in the folder `doc/html/doxygen/`, also available on the web at
http://freesasa.github.io/.

After building the package, calling
 
    freesasa -h
    
explains how the commandline tool can be used.

Compatibility and dependencies
------------------------------

The program has been tested successfully with several versions of GNU
C Compiler and Clang/LLVM. The library can be built using only
standard C and GNU libraries. The standard build depends on
[json-c](https://github.com/json-c/json-c) and
[libxml2](http://xmlsoft.org/). These can be disabled by configuring
with `--disable-json` and `--disable-xml` respectively.

Developers who want to do testing need to install the Check unit
testing framework. Building the full reference manual requires Doxygen
(version > 1.8.8). Building the Python bindings requires
Cython. Changing the selection parser and lexer requires Flex and
Bison. These build options, which add extra dependencies, are disabled
by default to simplify installation for users only interested in the
command line tool and and/or C Library.
