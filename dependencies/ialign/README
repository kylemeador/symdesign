You need Perl installed for running iAlign.

Invoke iAlign by typing:

  > perl <intall_dir>/bin/ialign.pl

or
  > <intall_dir>/bin/ialign.pl

if your perl is installed at /usr/bin/perl.

You may set the following alias in .bashrc (in the bash shell)

  alias ialign='<intall_dir>/bin/ialign.pl'

and invoke ialign simply by

  > ialign


See examples under the "example" subdirectory.

Use the option -m for full documentation.
